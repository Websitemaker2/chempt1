      <h2>Apparatus and Materials</h2>
      <span class="p">
        • Glasses - we use them as a container of water with different
        temperatures.
      </span>
      <span class="p"> • Kettle: an instrument to have boiling water </span>
      <span class="p"> • Pitcher - a container of cold water </span>
      <span class="p">
        • Bowls - containers of the two different colored powders
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        • Spoons - we use them to transfer the powders from bowls to glasses.
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        • Milk powder and coffee powder - these two are the powders with
        different colors that we used in our experiment.
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        • Water - this is the element we use in our experiment to observe and
        hypothesize the possible cause of why certain solids dissolve faster in
        liquids with a higher temperature than others.
      </span>
      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <span class="p"> • We find a spot to conduct our experiment. </span>
      <span class="p">
        • We get all the equipment we need for the experiment.
      </span>
      <span class="p"> - Glasses </span>
      <span class="p"> - Kettle </span>
      <span class="p"> - Pitcher </span>
      <span class="p"> - Bowls </span>
      <span class="p"> - Spoons </span>
      <span class="p">
        • We get all the needed materials for the experiment.
      </span>
      <span class="p"> - Milk </span>
      <span class="p"> - Coffee </span>
      <span class="p"> - Water </span>
      <span class="p"> • We prepared the hot and cold water </span>
      <span class="p">
        - Boil a cup of water in the kettle for 3 minutes.
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        - Get the stored pitcher with cold water in the refrigerator.
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        • Given that we had prepared all the needed equipment and materials, we
        began to conduct our experiment.
      </span>
      <span class="p"> - We place two transparent glasses on the table. </span>
      <span class="p">
        - Put the hot water in one glass and the cold water in the other glass.
      </span>
      <span class="p"> - Put the coffee in the hot water. </span>
      <span class="p"> - Put the milk in the cold water. </span>
      <span class="p"> Given that, we wait for the results. </span>
      <span class="p">
        <h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
        <span class="p">
          <span class="p">
            When dealing with hot water or the kettle, we recommend using
            potholders to avoid burns and always keeping children away to
            prevent accidents.
