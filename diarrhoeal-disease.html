      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <span class="p">
        The reason we chose to do this experiment is to know what's the
        difference between the properties and structures of hot and cold water.

        <h2>Summary of Experiment</h2>
        <span class="p">
          The first thing we did on the experiment is of course we gathered all
          the needed materials, followed safe protocols then we did the
          experiment, the way we did the experiment is explained on the
          experimental setup.

        <h2>Comparison with Expectations</h2>
        <span class="p">
          So after we did the experiment, it surprisingly surpassed my
          expectations the powder on the hot water melted much faster than the
          cold water, the results I expected were, that the hot and cold water
          isn't significantly different so the difference isn't really great but
          looking at the result of the experiment it did somehow met my
          expectations.

        <h2>Observations and Patterns</h2>
        <span class="p">
          While conducting our experiment I noticed that when powder is added to
          hot water, the rapid dissolution is affected by water's high specific
          heat, that helps and ease the absorption and retention of heat energy.
          The polar nature and hydrogen bonding of water molecules contribute to
          the efficient breakdown and dispersion of the powder, resulting in a
          clear solution.On the other hand, when the powder was placed in the
          cold water, the slower dissolution aligns with water's density
          anomalies and lower kinetic energy at lower temperatures. The cohesive
          and adhesive properties of water, influenced by hydrogen bonding, play
          a role in the slower dispersion of particles in cold water.

        <h2>Learning from the Experiment</h2>
        <span class="p">
          Through the experiment, we gained valuable and new information about
          the properties and structures of water. The rapid dissolution of
          powder in hot water highlighted the significance of water's high
          specific heat, allowing it to absorb and retain heat energy
          efficiently. Observing the slower dissolution in cold water provided a
          practical illustration of water's density anomalies and lower kinetic
          energy at lower temperatures. The cohesive and adhesive properties of
          water, particularly influenced by hydrogen bonding, became evident as
          the particles struggled to disperse, showcasing the impact of
          temperature on these interactions.

        <span class="p">
          Overall, the experiment deepened my understanding of water's unique
          characteristics, including its polarity, hydrogen bonding, specific
          heat capacity, and solvent properties. This hands-on experience
          provided a tangible connection to theoretical knowledge, reinforcing
          the importance of these water properties in real-world scenarios.
