        • Figure 1: Time taken for powder dissolution in hot and cold water.
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        • In hot water, the powder dissolved in approximately 8 seconds, while
        in cold water, it took around 30 seconds.
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        • A clear pattern is observed, indicating that higher water temperature
        associates with faster powder dissolution.
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        • These results emphasize the impact of temperature on water's
        properties, showcasing how heat energy influences the dissolution
        process. Understanding these properties is crucial for various
        real-world applications.
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        • The experiment focused on a specific type of powder, and results may
        vary with different substances. Additionally, external factors like room
        temperature might have influenced the outcomes.
      </span>
      <span class="p">
        • The results highlight a straightforward relationship between water
        temperature and powder dissolution time, providing a clear understanding
        of the experiment's outcomes.
